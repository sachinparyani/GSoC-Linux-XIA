I will be maintian my code here before pushing it in the master branch. This repository will contain all the code snippet and Documnetation that Linux_XIA will use. 

The wiki for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/sachinparyani/GSoC-Linux-XIA/blob/master/rhashtable_fib.c)

As of now, the code has been written and all the principals have been tested. What is left is the [net-eval] (https://github.com/AltraMayor/XIA-for-Linux/wiki/Forwarding-performance-evaluation) performance test.
